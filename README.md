# Low-Latency-Game-Relay-Self-Hosted-VPN-for-Gaming
## Introduction
Low-latency game relay solutions, particularly self-hosted VPNs, are gaining popularity among competitive gamers who want to reduce ping, avoid ISP throttling, and bypass regional restrictions. This guide covers everything you need to know about setting up and optimizing a self-hosted VPN for gaming.

## What is a Low-Latency Game Relay?
A game relay is a network setup that routes your gaming traffic through an optimized path to reduce latency (ping). A self-hosted VPN allows you to control the relay server, ensuring better performance and security compared to commercial VPNs.

## Features
gaming relay is a network optimization technique that:
- Routes your game traffic through an optimal path
- Reduces the number of network hops.
- Avoids congested ISP routes
- WireGuard integration for best performance

## what is wireguard
WireGuard is a free and open-source software that implements a VPN (Virtual Private Network) protocol. It's designed to be fast, secure, and easy to use, aiming to be a modern replacement for older VPN technologies like IPsec and OpenVPN. WireGuard achieves this through a streamlined design, utilizing modern cryptography and a small codebase, making it both efficient and simpler to audit.
